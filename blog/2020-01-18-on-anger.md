> Zuko has a complicated relationship with anger. Here we explore it in relation to some ancient Stoic philosophy and the modern philosophy of Jordan Peterson.

Anger in general is looked at differently depending on who you talk to. People *generally* fall into two different camps when thinking about anger:

1. Those who view it as bad and something to avoid.
2. Those who view it as something that can be harnessed and that drives them toward success.

Jordan Peterson is one that advocates for the second approach toward anger saying 
> "There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character." 
Peterson advises that we need to find the line between the destructive power of anger and the productive side that leads to strength of character. 

I personally believe that the first approach toward anger is the better one, but it needs to be understood more completely. Over the past year or so I have been reading more about Stoicism and the philosophers associated with it. They have a lot to say about Anger and how to deal with it. I highly recommend reading more about it. In fact it was [this article by Donald Robertson](https://medium.com/stoicism-philosophy-as-a-way-of-life/stoicism-versus-jordan-peterson-6a5d22911315) that got me thinking about this topic and how it is addressed in Avatar: The Last Airbender. 
 
## Zuko's Anger

At the start of the series Zuko falls directly into the second group. From the get go he is a very angry young man, and uses that anger to get what he wants. Many of his reasons to be angry are understandable.  He has been banished from his home and country by an unloving father who burned half of his face the last time they saw each other. 

That anger he feels is what fuels his drive to catch the Avatar and regain his honor. It is also what literally drives his fire-bending. Unfortunately his anger creates an emotional wall around himself that pushes people away. 

In the first season he berates Uncle Iroh and doesn't listen to his advice. He pushes his crew away too and leads his ship with no regard to the well being of those under him. 

In the episode *[The Chase](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chase)* Zuko ends up fighting Azula along with Team Avatar and Uncle Iroh. Azula shoots fire into Iroh's chest and is able to escape. When Uncle falls to the ground unconscious Zuko is devastated. Team Avatar sees that Iroh is hurt and Katara offers to help heal him. Rather than allow the help Uncle needs, Zuko lashes out in anger demanding that they leave him alone.

Later on in the series Zuko loses his fire-bending ability once he has joined Team Avatar and doesn't have the same anger toward Aang anymore. Without that driving his motivation, he is forced to reconnect with fire-bending on a new and deeper level.

## A Better Way
Zuko was able to do quite a bit with anger driving him. Just look to his accomplishments as The Blue Spirit for proof. Zuko had wholeheartedly taken Jordan Peterson's viewpoint and strived to use the anger he had to strengthen his character. He viewed himself through a particular lens that necessitated him to stoke the flames of his anger in order to improve his life, but was that the best way to live? 

Donald Robertson in the article I linked to above said this (emphasis mine): 
> "...anger may be sufficient but not necessary to achieve good things, such as overthrowing a tyranny or winning a boxing match. In other words, there might be **a better way** of achieving the same result. Perhaps there’s always a better way of achieving the same result, without anger. People motivate themselves in lots of different ways, without having to draw upon anger. Moreover, if there were any disadvantages to anger, that would tip the balance in favour of alternative ways of responding. By analogy, it’s certainly true that you can get energy by eating candy. However, you can also get energy from other sources, such as fruit or vegetables, which don’t have the health disadvantages. You might say that anger is an energy but nevertheless what if it’s one of our least healthy sources of energy or motivation? Candy sure gives you energy but it also rots your teeth. What if anger does motivate you but also rots your brain? Anger is a motivation but is it a healthy motivation?"

The Stoics would argue that it isn't. Epictetus said "It’s not things that upset us but our opinions about them." Marcus Aurelius said 
> "And when you do become angry, be ready to apply this thought, that to fly into a passion is not a sign of manliness, but rather, to be kind and gentle, for in so far as these qualities are more human, they are also more manly; and it is the man who possesses such virtues who has strength, nerve, and fortitude, and not one who is ill-humoured and discontented; for the nearer a man comes in his mind to impassibility [i.e., freedom from unhealthy passions like anger], the nearer he comes to strength, and as [over-indulgence in] grief is a mark of weakness, so is anger too, for those who yield to either have been wounded and have surrendered to the enemy." *— Meditations, 11.18*

So we can see that they look at anger from a completely different perspective. Rather than trying to channel the anger towards something positive, we need to change how we look at it by recognizing the beliefs the anger is based on are faulty. We look to replace those faulty beliefs with more rationality. 

In the beginning, Zuko would likely view his anger as a "righteous anger". As Donald Robertson said *"The Stoics would think that’s just more of the same because whether anger is 'righteous' or not, either way it’s still an inherently neurotic, demanding way of thinking that places more importance on events that merely befall us than upon our own character and way of responding to events."*

In the end, Zuko learns from the dragons Ran and Shaw that he needs to draw his fire-bending from a better source that he describes as *"the sun, but inside of you"*. It might be a bit of a stretch to say that this is what the Stoics are trying to teach, but I don't think it is too far off. If we can recognize that the anger we feel is based on our faulty beliefs about external events, we can then look inward to our proverbial *"sun inside"* and move to a better plane of living
