> Zuko has a complicated relationship with anger. Here we explore it in relation to some ancient Stoic philosophy and the modern philosophy of Jordan Peterson.

Anger in general is looked at differently depending on who you talk to. People *generally* fall into two different camps when thinking about anger:

1. Those who view it as bad and something to avoid.
2. Those who view it as something that can be harnessed and that drives them toward success.

Jordan Peterson is one that advocates for the second approach toward anger saying 
> "There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character." 
Peterson advises that we need to find the line between the destructive power of anger and the productive side that leads to strength of character. 

I personally believe that the first approach toward anger is the better one, but it needs to be understood more completely. 

## Zuko's Anger

At the start of the series Zuko falls directly into the second group. From the get go he is a very angry person, and uses that anger to get what he wants. Many of his reasons to be angry are understandable.  He has been banished from his home and country by an unloving father who burned half of his face the last time they saw each other. 

That anger he feels is what fuels his drive to catch the Avatar and regain his honor. It is also what literally drives his power when fire-bending. Unfortunately his anger creates an emotional wall around himself that pushes people away. 

In the first season he berates Uncle Iroh and doesn't listen to his advice. He pushes his crew away too and leads his ship with no regard to the well being of those under him. 

In the episode *[The Chase](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chase)* Zuko ends up fighting Azula along with Team Avatar and Uncle Iroh. Azula shoots fire into Iroh's chest and is able to escape. When Uncle falls to the ground unconscious, Zuko is devastated. Team Avatar sees that Iroh is hurt and Katara offers to help heal him. Rather than allow the help Uncle needs, Zuko lashes out in anger demanding that they leave him alone.

Later on in the series Zuko loses his fire-bending ability once he has joined Team Avatar and doesn't have the same anger toward Aang anymore. Without that driving his motivation, he is forced to reconnect with fire-bending on a new and deeper level.

## A Better Way
Zuko was able to do quite a bit with anger driving him. Just look to his accomplishments as The Blue Spirit for proof. Zuko had wholeheartedly taken Jordan Peterson's viewpoint and strived to use the anger he had to strengthen his character. He viewed himself through a particular lens that necessitated him to stoke the flames of his anger in order to improve his life, but was that the best way to live? 

Donald Robertson, a cognitive-behavioural psychotherapist and author of several books on Stoicism, writes in the article I linked to above said this (emphasis mine): 
> "...anger may be sufficient but not necessary to achieve good things, such as overthrowing a tyranny or winning a boxing match. In other words, there might be **a better way** of achieving the same result. Perhaps there’s always a better way of achieving the same result, without anger. People motivate themselves in lots of different ways, without having to draw upon anger. Moreover, if there were any disadvantages to anger, that would tip the balance in favour of alternative ways of responding. By analogy, it’s certainly true that you can get energy by eating candy. However, you can also get energy from other sources, such as fruit or vegetables, which don’t have the health disadvantages. You might say that anger is an energy but nevertheless what if it’s one of our least healthy sources of energy or motivation? Candy sure gives you energy but it also rots your teeth. What if anger does motivate you but also rots your brain? Anger is a motivation but is it a healthy motivation?"

The Stoics would argue that it isn't. Epictetus said "It’s not things that upset us but our opinions about them." Marcus Aurelius said 
> "And when you do become angry, be ready to apply this thought, that to fly into a passion is not a sign of manliness, but rather, to be kind and gentle, for in so far as these qualities are more human, they are also more manly; and it is the man who possesses such virtues who has strength, nerve, and fortitude, and not one who is ill-humoured and discontented; for the nearer a man comes in his mind to impassibility, the nearer he comes to strength." *— Meditations, 11.18*

So we can see that they look at anger from a completely different perspective. Rather than trying to channel the anger towards something positive, we need to change how we look at it by recognizing that the beliefs the anger is based on are faulty. We look to replace those faulty beliefs with more rationality. 

In the beginning, Zuko would likely view his anger as a "righteous anger". As Donald Robertson said *"The Stoics would think that’s just more of the same because whether anger is 'righteous' or not, either way it’s still an inherently neurotic, demanding way of thinking that places more importance on events that merely befall us than upon our own character and way of responding to events."*

As I was preparing for this episode I thought about the times when I've been angry, and I want you to take a minute to think about a recent time when you've been angry too. What did the anger do for you? Did it really help the situation, or did it make it worse? I know that it has rarely, if ever benefitted me. It usually makes things worse.

Noah Rasheta on the "Secular Buddhism" podcast teaches us about the need to [break the chain of reactivity](https://secularbuddhism.com/71-breaking-the-chain-of-reactivity/). He talks about the London Underground's constant warning to "mind the gap" between the platform and the train. He makes the case that we need to "mind the gap" between the things in our life that cause us to get emotional, or angry, and our reaction to those things. By making ourselves aware of this gap, we break out of this "chain of reactivity" that he calls it and are able to react better to every day situations. We are then able to avoid the "neurotic, demanding way of thinking" that anger forces on us.

[DailyStoic.com](https://dailystoic.com/stoic-response-anger/) urges us to 'Remember Marcus Aurelius’s observation, “how much more harmful are the consequences of anger…than the circumstances that aroused them in us.” Yelling might make you feel better for a second, but does it actually solve the problem? Of course not. Arguing with a rude person only offers them more opportunity to be rude. Getting worked up over car trouble doesn’t fix the car, it just raises your blood pressure. Berating an employee who messed up? Now they’ll either resent you or they’ll be more likely to screw up again in the future because they’re nervous and self-conscious.

Every situation is made better by a cool head. Even powerful people who know that anger is a powerful and effective tool will tell you that there is a big difference between deliberately expressing your frustrations (to make a point, to motivate someone, to defend yourself) and flying off the handle. Without the ability to recognize and direct your emotions, you become a slave to them.'

In the end, Zuko learns from the dragons Ran and Shaw that there is a better way to firebend, that anger isn't the answer.  He describes this as *"the sun, but inside of you"*.  If we can recognize that the anger we feel is based on our faulty beliefs about external events, we can then look inward to our proverbial *"sun inside"* and move to a better plane of living.
